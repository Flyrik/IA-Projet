# IA-Projet


The goal of this project is to understand and implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image
classification using different architectures, particularly the VGG model. You will work with the CIFAR-10
dataset and optimize results using regularization and normalization techniques. You will also compare the
performance of various optimizers.
